### Background

What will be in Pressure in the Boiler A boiler or steam generator is a device used to create steam by applying heat energy to water.
Although the definitions are somewhat flexible, it can be said that older steam generators were commonly termed boilers and worked
at low to medium pressure (7–2,000 kPa or 1–290 psi) but, at pressures above this, it is more usual to speak of a steam generator.

A boiler or steam generator is used wherever a source of steam is required. The form and size depends on the application: mobile
steam engines such as steam locomotives, portable engines and steam-powered road vehicles typically use a smaller boiler that forms
an integral part of the vehicle; stationary steam engines, industrial installations and power stations will usually have a larger separate
steam generating facility connected to the point-of-use by piping. A notable exception is the steam-powered fireless locomotive, where
separately-generated steam is transferred to a receiver (tank) on the locomotive. 

The thermodynamics of export cogeneration dictate that higher HP steam conditions result in more electricity produced, something which has driven the industry to achieve ever higher pressures and temperatures without considering the economics. In practice, as conditions are increased, the additional capital cost outstrips the additional electricity. 

The higher HP conditions have also driven a second trend : to adopt single drum boilers instead of continuing to use bi-drum designs. Whilst this is the right approach at high conditions, care needs to be taken in selecting the details of the design. Now we need to help the company to make sure that we can have pressure in the boiler in control.
